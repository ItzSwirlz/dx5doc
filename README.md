# dx5doc
A redocumentation of DirectX 5, brought to you by a bunch of Infomaniacs.

## Why?
Microsoft tends to remove documentations for old versions of their libraries. When decompiling/reverse engineering a game, it can be tricky to understand the data structures and functions when working with DirectX code.

The SDK does not contain any documentation, rather points to documentation on the official MS website which doesnt exist. The Wayback Machine does not go back far enough, the earliest records are 1998 when DX 6 came out.

Using Doxygen, the goal of this project is to annotate the headers to try to document as much of the code as possible through old media/books and whatnot. Hopefully this will serve as reference for future decompilation projects using DX 5.
